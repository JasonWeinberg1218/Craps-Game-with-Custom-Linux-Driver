# Craps-Game-with-Custom-Linux-Driver

A console-based game based on the popular dice game Craps. Wrote a custom Linux device driver for a virtual device whose sole task was to generate a random dice roll. In addition, wrote the Craps game, which issued a read request via a system call to the virtual device, which would return a random integer between 1 and 6, each time a new dice roll was needed. The Craps game was fully functional and followed all the regular rules of the original dice game, using the virtual device to generate new dice rolls when necessary. The driver was written entirely in C, as well as the game, which also uses the C standard library.
